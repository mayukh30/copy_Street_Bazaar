## 🎯 Real-World Problem Statement

India’s street food vendors lack access to:
- Reliable suppliers with consistent pricing
- A platform to compare deals, quality, and ratings
- Scheduling or delivery options
- Purchase history or digital invoices

Their current system is informal, manual, and often exploitative.

**Fresh Mart** is a digital marketplace designed specifically to address this supply chain gap.
